# OS-Simulation

Implement a simple operating system (SOS) developed in java. 
The SOS is expected provide a specified system allowing for processes and memory management. 
The whole system allows up to 10 processes currently stay in the memory, only one of them is running on the CPU. 
The others are either in the Ready Queue, or blocked in the Disk Queue (i.e. waiting for disk I/O). 
Each process has its PCB. 
For memory management, choose paging as management methods. 
No requirement on deadlock prevention or virtual memory.
